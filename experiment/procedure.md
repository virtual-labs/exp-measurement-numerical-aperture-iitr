## Procedure<br>

1.  Connect the circuit by using the circuit diagram.
2.  Plug the AC mains. Light should appear at the end of the fiber on the NA fig. 1 The light intensity should increase.
3.  Hold the screen, provided in the Kit vertically at a distance of 15 mm (L) from the emitting fiber end and view the red spot on the screen. A dark room will facilitate good contrast. Position the screen-cum-scale to measure the diameter (W) of the spot. Choose the largest diameter.
4.  Compute NA from the formula  
    &emsp;NA = sinθ<sub>max</sub>\=W/(4L<sup>2</sup>+W<sup>2</sup>)<sup>½</sup>  
    Repeat the experiment for 10mm and 25mm distance of the screen.
5.  Calculate the acceptance angle θ<sub>a</sub> = sin<sup>-1</sup>(NA).
